Water Treatment Plant Leak Detection

Roboflow-Powered Computer Vision + Enterprise Integration Demo

A real-world application demonstrating how Roboflow’s computer vision tools can be integrated with enterprise systems to solve critical infrastructure challenges. This project shows how a developer with zero prior computer vision experience went from dataset to production-ready leak detection and automated emergency response in just 4 days.

Project Overview

This demo highlights the power of Roboflow to rapidly build and deploy a model for detecting water treatment pump leaks, then connect that model to ChainSync’s environmental monitoring platform for automated multi-agency alerts and dispatch.

By combining:

Computer Vision (Roboflow) – Model trained and deployed in days, detecting leaks with 47–50% confidence

Enterprise Integration (ChainSync) – Automated alerts, risk scoring, and compliance documentation

Automated Response – Multi-agency coordination reducing response times to 15 minutes

Business Value – $50,000 in estimated savings from just two detected leaks

This project demonstrates how Roboflow makes the world programmable—turning raw images into real-time, actionable intelligence.

Demo Results
✅ Model Performance: Leak detection with 47-50% confidence
✅ Integration Status: ChainSync alerts successfully triggered
✅ Business Impact: $50,000 estimated savings from 2 detected leaks
✅ Response Time: 15 minutes automated emergency dispatch
✅ Scalability: Architecture ready for 16,000+ facilities nationwide

Quick Start
Prerequisites
pip install roboflow requests pillow

Configuration
API_KEY = "your_roboflow_api_key"
WORKSPACE = "water-treatment-equipment-status-detection"
PROJECT = "equipment-status-monitor-12qyy"
VERSION = 3

Basic Usage
from roboflow import Roboflow

rf = Roboflow(api_key=API_KEY)
model = rf.workspace(WORKSPACE).project(PROJECT).version(VERSION).model

prediction = model.predict("pump_image.jpg", confidence=40)
results = prediction.json()

for detection in results['predictions']:
    class_name = detection['class']
    confidence = detection['confidence']
    print(f"Detected: {class_name} ({confidence:.1%})")

Integration Results
